# Python Tuples 🐍

This repo provides a simple example of how VS Code/Codespaces enables an awesome platform for interactive learning experiences, using Jupyter notebooks and Pyodide.

## Getting Started

1. Open this repo and install the recommended extensions
1. Open the `Tuples.ipynb` file

    > Note: If you see raw JSON instead of the notebook view, right-click the editor tab, select `Reopen Editor With...` and then click `Jupyter Notebook`
    
1. Edit/run cells in the notebook, without even having Python/Jupyter installed 🚀
